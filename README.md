# NEURONExperiments

### The goal of these experiments is to simulate the dynamics of the Nigrostriatal Pathway and its changing state in the context of Schizophrenia.

#### D2Receptor.py contains a model of the dynamics of the D2 Autoreceptor 
#### Equations and state variables referenced from https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012082#sec002 

#### utils.py contains helper methods and classes interpolated from Yale's NEURON Python library https://nrn.readthedocs.io/en/8.0.1/python/programming/neuronpython.html 

### Requirements to run D2Receptor.py
#### Python 3.7 
#### NEURON 8.2.6
