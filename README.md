# NEURONExperiments

### This project implements a basic Spiking Neural Network that models Glutamatergic and Dopaminergic input from the cortex and Substantia Nigra respectively to innervate Medium Spiny Neurons in the Dorsal Striatum. The result is a modulatory effect of dopamine concentration in the Striatum.

### The goal of these experiments is to simulate the dynamics of the Basal Ganglia and its dysfunction in the context of Parkinson's Disease.
